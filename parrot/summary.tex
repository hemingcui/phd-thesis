We have presented \xxx, a simple, practical \pthread-compatible system for
making threads deterministic and stable. It offers a new contract to
developers.  By default, it schedules synchronizations using round-robin,
vastly reducing schedules.  When the default schedules are slow, it
allows developers to write performance hints for speed.  We believe this
contract eases writing correct, efficient programs.  We have
also presented an ecosystem formed by integrating \xxx with model checker
\dbug, so that \dbug can thoroughly check \xxx's schedules, and \xxx can
greatly improve \dbug's coverage.  Results on a diverse set of \nprog
programs, roughly \overeach more than any prior evaluation,
show that \xxx is easy to use, fast, and scalable; and it improves \dbug's
coverage by many orders of magnitude.  We have released \xxx's source
code, entire benchmark suite, and raw results at \github.
