%Through conceiving, building, applying, and evaluating \smt systems, we have
%demonstrated that \smt is feasible; it can stabilize program behaviors
%for better reliability, work both efficiently and deterministically, and
%greatly improve precision of static analysis. We invite readers to join us in exploring this fertile and
%exciting direction of stable multithreading and reliable parallelism.
