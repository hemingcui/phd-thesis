\begin{abstract}

The thesis proposal is a type of contract between the faculty and the student. 
An accepted thesis proposal indicates that the work proposed by the student, 
once completed, will be accepted by the faculty as sufficiently innovative and 
substantial as to be recognized with the award of the degree. It is part of 
the training of the student's research apprenticeship that the form of this 
proposal must be as concise as those proposals required by major funding 
agencies.
