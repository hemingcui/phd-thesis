Multithreaded programs are notoriously hard to get right, and a key reason is: these programs have \emph{too many} possible thread interleavings (or schedules) at runtime. It is extremely challenging for existing techniques to test, analyze, or verify all these schedules, making multithreaded programs prone to various reliability and security bugs. This thesis introduces Stable multithreading (\smt), a new idea that can greatly reduce the number of possible schedules for multi-threaded programs on all inputs with reasonable performance overhead, making these programs much easier to get right. This thesis also presents three \smt software systems, \tern, \peregrine, and \parrot, with each addressing distinct research challenges. To show that \smt can greatly improve software reliability and security, this thesis describes two promising applications of \smt for reliability: (1) greatly improving schedule coverage of a popular systematic testing technique called model checking, leading to XXX; and  (2) greatly improving precision of program analysis for multi-threaded programs, leading to several new harmful concurrency bugs detected in heavily tested programs.
