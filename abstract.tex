Multithreaded programs are notoriously hard to get right, and a key reason is: 
these programs may run into too many possible thread interleavings at runtime. 
This article introduces Stable multithreading (\smt), a new paradigm that can greatly 
 reduce the number of possible thread interleavings and improve software 
 reliability and security. This article also presents three \smt software 
 systems, with each addressing different research challenges. In addition, this 
 article describes two promissing applications enabled by our software systems.
