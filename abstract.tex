Multithreaded programs are notoriously hard to get right, and a key reason is:
these programs have \emph{too many} possible thread interleavings (or
schedules) at runtime. It is extremely challenging for existing techniques to
test, analyze, or verify all these schedules, making multithreaded programs
prone to various reliability and security bugs. This article introduces
 Stable multithreading (\smt), a new idea that can greatly
 reduce the number of possible schedules for multi-threaded programs on all
 inputs with reasonable performance overhead, making
 these programs much easier to get right. This article also presents three
 \smt software systems, \tern, \peregrine, and \parrot, with each addressing
 distinct research challenges. To show that \smt can greatly improve software
 reliability and security, this article describes two promising applications of \smt:
 (1) greatly improving schedule coverage of a popular systematic testing technique
 called model checking, and  (2) enabling transparent state-machine replication for multi-threaded programs.
