\chapter{Reproducing Concurrency Bugs} \label{sec:bugs}

\section{State of the Art} \label{sec:bugs-intro}
First, concurrency bugs are extremely hard to reproduce in traditional thread runtimes.

Second, \dmt aims to address this problem, but actually it may aggravate this problem.

Third, \smt can address this problem. Introduce concurency bugs with respect to sync-schedules.

\section{Detection Algorithm} \label{sec:bugs-detection}

Can also detect input dependent concurrency bugs.
TBD.

\section{Evaluation} \label{sec:bugs-evaluation}

Bugs table. Introduce them.

Detection results. Use peregrine's results.

Bug reproduction results.

Bug stability.
